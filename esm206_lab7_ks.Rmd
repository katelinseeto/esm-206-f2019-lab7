### Attach packages and install effsize, and kableExtra

```{r}
install.packages("effsize")
install.packages("kableExtra")

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(effsize)
library(kableExtra)

```


## Read in and explore Flint water data

```{r}
flint_pb <- read_csv("flint_water.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(pb_immediate = pb_bottle_1_ppb_first_draw, 
         pb_2min = pb_bottle_2_ppb_2_mins_flushing) 
```

## Visually explore data

```{r}
# Histograms:
ggplot(flint_pb, aes(x = pb_immediate)) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(flint_pb, aes(x= pb_2min)) +
  geom_histogram()

# QQ Plot 
ggplot(flint_pb, aes(sample = pb_immediate)) +
  geom_qq()

ggplot(flint_pb, aes(sample = pb_2min)) +
  geom_qq()

# They are NOT normally distributed; we'll still say we want to compare means, and can do that comfortably because of CLT (sampling distribution of the means will be normal).
```
